# StepUp

StepUp is an ecommerce web application for customers seeking to purchase shoes online.

This is the fifth and last milestone project for the Code Institute Diploma in Fullstack Software Development.

Users can create accounts and administrators have full write and delete access to all data. To test an administrator account, send me a pm at contact@johnvenkiah.com and I'll send the details.

You can view the deployed site [here](https://stepup-shoes.herokuapp.com/)

## Project Overview

StepUp is an assignment for the Code Institute Diploma in Full Stack Software Development, but also meant to be applicable in a real world scenario (except for the products being fictional of course).

The focus points for this application are ecommerce, using the Django framework and the ability to go through with a payment for an order.

## User Experience

### Strategy

#### Primary Goals

The site owners primary goals are:

* To be able to sell the stores products online

* To have the ability to add, remove or edit products in the store

* To access a customers order, edit and/or remove it if necessary

* To access and keep track of customer information

* To own a website which is easy to use and navigate, for all types of users on all devices.

A potential customers primary goals are:

* To be able to view details of and purchase any of the available products from the online store.

* To be able to register for an account

* To see my order history in their account

* To be able to edit their account details or remove their account

* To easily navigate the whole website and keep track of all user interactions, for example the products in their cart and how much they have spent

#### Business Model

I have chosen a fairly traditional B2C (Business to Customer without middle person) application, which has a straightforward and user friendly interface. This online store offers no products of their own and relies on the wholesale of branded products. A real world version of the store would list all the retailers it is affiliated with.

The intentions should be obvious and users should know as soon as they enter the site what it offers and how to use it's features.

#### Marketing

This site has a Facebook Business page with a link on the home page too. It can be viewed [here](https://www.facebook.com/stepupshoes-estore/)

Upon registering for an account, customers can check a box to receive news and offers through email via Mailchimp.

### Structure

This website has over 15 pages, with a dynamic navigation bar at the top of the screen, giving users access to the most important pages at all times.

#### Pages

* Home - The landing page of the site, with a full screen carousel hero image giving first time visitors a nice welcome

* Products List - This is a list of the products when clicking on a category in the navbar, or performing a search

* Product Detail - The dedicated page for a specific product, where users can read a description and perform all given tasks for the product

* Manage Products - This is where admin users can edit, add and remove products and product details
