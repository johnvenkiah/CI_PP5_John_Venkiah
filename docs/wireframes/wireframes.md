# Wireframes

Here are wireframes for the pages on the StepUp site. I have omitted the allauth account pages such as email confirm and password reset, as I have only customised them to fit the site, and they are very similar to the change password (allauth page) and remove account pages.

I have included wireframes on desktop, tablet and mobile. Click the expander to view the image.
