# Testing

I have thoroughly tested the StepUp web application manually, and partially with automated tests.

I discovered some bugs during the testing phase, which you can read about [here](https://github.com/johnvenkiah/CI_PP5_John_Venkiah#bugs)

## Manual testing

### Overview

I have tested the features against their user stories that cover them.

Testing of user story 1:

*As a user, the intention of the specific page is made clear to me, so that I know the purpose of that page*

This test is difficult to document, as it is covered by all the features and pages. I will give it a shot here though.

**The Home Page**

- **Intention: to entice the user to want to browse products**

The carousel images are well taken photos, the menus are clear and the page is not cluttered.

- **Conclusion: tests passed**

**The Products Page**

- **Intention: display the list of products according to the users query**

The user can filter results by search query, clicking on brand, gender, of items are new or on sale, or sort the products by name, category, price or rating.
