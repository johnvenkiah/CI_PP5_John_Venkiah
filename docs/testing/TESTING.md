# Testing

I have thoroughly tested the StepUp web application manually, and partially with automated tests.

I discovered some bugs during the testing phase, which you can read about [here](https://github.com/johnvenkiah/CI_PP5_John_Venkiah#bugs)

## Manual testing

### Overview

I have tested the features against their user stories that cover them.

Testing of user story 1:

*As a user, the intention of the specific page is made clear to me, so that I know the purpose of that page*

This test is difficult to document, as it is covered by all the features and pages. I will give it a shot here though.

**The Home Page**

- **Intention: to entice the user to want to browse products**

The carousel images are well taken photos, the menus are clear and the page is not cluttered.

- **Conclusion: tests passed**

**The Products Page**

- **Intention: display the list of products according to the users query**

The user can filter results by search query, clicking on brand, gender, of items are new or on sale, or sort the products by name, category, price or rating.

- **Conclusion: tests passed**

**The Product Detail Page**

- **Intention: display the relevant information for the product in a tasteful manner and making it easy for the user to add the product to their cart or Wishlist**

The displayed information of the product is the art nr, name, brand, gender, category, description, details, price, whether on discount or not and the product image. This info is generous according to me, giving me enough info to make my decision if the product falls to my liking.

The quantity and size controls are easy to understand, and adding to the cart or Wishlist is done by clicking once on the button in question.

**The Cart Page**

- **Intention: to show the user an overview of what she or he has intended to buy so the user can adjust the quantity, proceed to checkout or continue browsing**

The user has a clear overview of the cart wherever they are on the site, thanks to the floating grand total and product count at the top right.

Going to the page, the user can clearly see the intention of the page. The count of items is at the top together with the page title. All items are visible as a table, including their image, name, size, art nr and price as well as fields where the user can adjust the quantity and remove the item from the cart. The grand total here is written in large fonts, and the buttons are large too.

The quantity and size controls are easy to understand, and adding to the cart or Wishlist is done by clicking once on the button in question.
